                        <h3>Filmfare</h3>
                        <p>The story is high on emotional connect. You get to see the personal side of a 
                          professional soldier and can relate to the sacrifices he gets to make while serving 
                          his country. Thankfully, Vicky doesn't have any romantic involvement either with 
                          Yami Gautam -- who plays both a nurse and a spy, don't ask why -- or with Kirti 
                          Kulhari, who plays a grounded helicopter pilot. The josh of the soldiers is shown 
                          to be all time high as well. It's Vicky Kaushal's dedication that compels you to forget
                          the mistakes and watch the film. Channeling his inner Martin Sheen, he method acts to 
                          glory amidst the madness and comes out triumphant from the heart of darkness. Take him 
                          away from the scheme of things and the film falls flat. He has once again shown that 
                          you can cast him in any sort of a role in any sort of a film and he’ll deliver his 
                          hundred per cent.  The patriotic fervour behind the project can’t be denied and better 
                          detailing definitely would have added another layer to the film.

                        <h3>Times of India</h3>
                      <p>Aditya Dhar’s unforgiving war drama incorporates the events that led to the surgical 
                        strikes as seen through the eyes of protagonist Major Vihaan Singh Shergill (Vicky Kaushal). 
                        The film scores higher on the technical front than creative. The combat sequences, 
                        ambush, gunfire, fistfights, sniper shots are realistically shot. The camera 
                        tactfully follows the soldiers like a shadow. Sound effects are crucial to combat 
                        film storytelling, and this war drama uses it effectively for most parts. The 
                        sounds of weapons and bullets are captured well but some unnecessary sounds 
                        (loud whispers, noisy footsteps) beat the very purpose of a covert mission.
                        The soldiers give up their today for our tomorrow and no words can signify or 
                        repay the sacrifices they make for our country. Uri puts a spotlight on the 
                        thankless job they do with passion in their hearts and fire in their bellies. 
                        The film is a fitting tribute to the Indian Army conceptually but cinematically, 
                        it’s not a film without flaws.

                        <h3>First Post</h3> 
                        <p>Based on true events of September 2016, director Aditya Dhar declares that his 
                          film is a ‘Tribute to a brave new India’. Nationalism is writ large all over this 
                          war drama that leads up to and reimagines the retaliatory surgical strikes conducted 
                          by the Indian Army against militant launch pads in ‘Pakistani-administered Kashmir’.
                          The film would have benefitted greatly from some surgery, or at least amputation, 
                          on the second half. Considering that the entire film is leading up to the events 
                          that occurred in the 11 days after the 18 September attack, that is where greater 
                          heft was needed. What Dhar squanders on the screenplay, he makes up for in the details. 
                          Stefan Richter’s carefully designed and executed action scenes, Sashwat 
                          Sachdev’s thunderous background score, sound mix, sound design and special 
                          effects simulate authenticity. As far as war dramas go, Uri: The Surgical Strike 
                          is a confidently made film that comes out guns blazing. And when the guns are not 
                          blazing, Kaushal certainly is.

                        <h3>The Indian Express </h3>
                        <p>
                          Because this is a Bollywood film, we get a hand-to-hand combat moment for our 
                          hero Major Vihaan Shergill (Kaushal). How else are we to appreciate his bravery? 
                          The major and his derring-do commando unit, which includes Captain Karan Kashyap 
                          (Raina), spearheads the surgical strikes, and we get a Hollywood-influenced build 
                          up: chatter amongst war-room strategists, those who are in-charge of advanced 
                          weaponry, and the men who give the orders. A young wet-behind-the-ear nerd and 
                          his ‘creation’ causes an old warhorse to say: son, you may have won us the war. 
                          Straight out of a Hollywood flick. Uri: The Surgical Strike is slickly made, and on the whole keeps you watching 
                          despite some clunky passages. It’s always good to have movies in which the 
                          soldiers look real, and the conflict is taken seriously, even if the action 
                          is buoyed by such dialogues as ‘unhe Kashmir chaihye, humein unka sar’. 
                          If that’s not jingoism, I don’t know what is. The Pakistani big-wigs are 
                          shown as a bunch of not exactly incompetents, but incapable of matching up to 
                          the Indians.
